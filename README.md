# Zory-Tippette-ECU-Projects

My Name is Zory Tippette, this repository is a collection of submodules linking to other repositories of projects I contributed to at my time at East Carolina University. Three of these are group projects done for a class, and I only committed to parts of each.

The first project "Retail Hell" is a 3D Unity Game made for a game design class. We ran out of time to finish the Game loop after 1 level, and there are no animations for characters, but it is still playable. I worked on:
- The main gameplay mechanics of running around to attend to each customer.
- The stress meter and it's functionality.
- All of the audio programming and stock sound/music choices.

The second project "Cinegenie" is a web app built in Vite+React that recommends movies to watch based on your own preferences.
I worked on:
- creating test cases for every webpage file using jest testing to test the page's functionality.
- integrating jest testing into the existing repository and making it work with everything else going on.

The third project is "Kooky Kreator", it is a small application that allows you to customize cookie recipes and even randomize new recipes.
I worked on:
- the function for saving recipes to text files.
- another function for loading saved recipes up into the application again for viewing.

The fourth project is a Ray Tracer that is able to render some simple shapes on screen, 
- developed in Python 
- Used the help of some premade libraries.

The fifth project is blender 3D modeling and rendering.
- The donut is modeled by me using online tutorials.
- The kitchen scene is made and rendered by me using free assets for the models and textures.
- The Landscape is a custom terrain made by me with tree images and free assets for the windmills and town.
