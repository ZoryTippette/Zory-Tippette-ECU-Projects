# Zory-Tippette-ECU-Projects

My Name is Zory Tippette, this repository is a collection of submodules linking to other repositories of projects I contributed to at my time at East Carolina University. All of these are group projects done for a class, and I only committed to parts of each.

The first project "Retail Hell" is a 3D Unity Game made for a game design class. We ran out of time to finish the Game loop after 1 level, and there are no animations for characters, but it is still playable. I worked on:
    - The main gameplay mechanics of running around to attend to each customer.
    - The stress meter and it's functionality.
    - All of the audio programming and stock sound/music choices.

The second project "Cinegenie" is a web app built in Vite+React that recommends movies to watch based on your own preferences.
I worked on:
    - creating test cases for every webpage file using jest testing to test the page's functionality.
    - integrating jest testing into the existing repository and making it work with everything else going on.

The third project is "Kooky Kreator", it is a small application that allows you to customize cookie recipes and even randomize new recipes.
I worked on:
    - the function for saving recipes to text files.
    - another function for loading saved recipes up into the application again for viewing.
